Step 1 Chop and soak the nuts
Cut the figs, dates and cashew nuts into small pieces, and soak them along with the raisins and tutti-fruity in the rum, red wine and beer (this is normally done 20-25 days in advance so that the dry fruits absorbs all the spirits). Also, soak dry yeast in water for 2-3 hours before the preparation of cake.

Step 2 Prepare the batter
Mix the butter and sugar along and beat the vanilla essence in it. Add in the eggs gradually to the vanilla essence mixture and mixing all the while. Then fold in the flour sifted with baking powder and mix in all the soaked ingredients.

Step 3 Prepare a baking tin
Grease a 1 kg baking tin with butter and sprinkle a little flour on the surface. Then place a sheet of paraffin paper on the bottom, and pour the cake batter into the tin. Bake the cake at 160 degree Celsius for about 20-25 minutes. Take out the cake from the mould and leave aside to cool it down.

Step 4 Prepare the icing
For the royal icing, make sure the egg whites are at room temperature before beginning. In a clean and dry bowl, place the egg whites, powdered sugar, and yeast. Using a hand whisk, beat all together on low speed until combined. Then stop the whisk and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Now, beat the mixture on medium speed until it turns very thick, shiny, stiff and white. The whole process should take not more than 7-10 minutes.

Step 5 Pour the icing
Check the texture to ensure that it is suitable for your needs. If you require a stiffer icing, add a little more powdered sugar at this point. Pour the icing on the cake and leave it to dry.

Step 6 Decorate as per your wish
If you want to add any decorative pieces to your cake, do that before the icing dries.
